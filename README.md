# C++ Primer (5th Edition) - Exercise solutions

This repository contains solutions to exercises presented in the [C++ Primer (5th Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113). These solutions are on purpose written in easy to understand manner so that the beginners - like me - are able to learn the C++ language with their own pace.

Consequently, I have tried my best to do the following:

1. Every exercise solution on purpose avoids using C++ language concepts which are not introduced in preceding chapters of the book.

2. Some of the example code provided by the book is modified to use more consistent variable naming and syntax.
