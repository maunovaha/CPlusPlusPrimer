# CPlusPlusPrimer

These exercises are developed based on the book "C++ Primer (5th Edition)". Hence, most of the code you see in this repository contains my personal notes and just trying out things to learn the language a bit better (this is how I roll).

For much better experience, I recommend buying the book yourself: https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113
